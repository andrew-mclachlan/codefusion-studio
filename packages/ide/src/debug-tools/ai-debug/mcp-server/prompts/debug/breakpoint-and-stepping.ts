 *
 * Prompts registered:
 * - breakpoint-and-inspect: Set breakpoint, run, inspect locals on hit
 * - source-search-and-debug: Find code by description, breakpoint, inspect
 * - conditional-breakpoint: Conditional breakpoint, catch multiple hits, compare
 * - step-and-disassemble: Step N instructions, show disassembly and registers
